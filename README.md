Welcome to Amalgam's github! As you can probably tell, it's not exactly finished right now. You are welcome to help, and if you do I recomend asking for an invite to the discord server.

The vision for this bot is that it is a automated mafia-like game host. It should be able to run to a degree that the players should only have to designate someone as the bot opperator, with that person still able to play. Once thats done, ANYONE should be able to contribute roles to the game, with (hopfully) easy to use frameworks. We are not at that stage yet, but with time, I hope we can be there one day.
